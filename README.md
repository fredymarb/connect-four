# connect-four
This is the first Ruby project made with TDD from The Odin Project's Full Stack Ruby on Rails curriculum

## Project objectives

Using TDD, build a command line Connect Four game where two human players can play against each other.

## Motivation for this project

This is an excellent opportunity to put my newly learned knowledge of TDD and RSpec to the test. Due to no prior TDD experience, and having just learned RSpec, this project will be very challenging.
